This plugin expects there to be one file per day because it doesn't track multiple changes to a file.

## Features
- Shows current streak in status bar (e.g. "ðŸ”¥ 5 days")
- Configurable folder to monitor
- Updates automatically on file changes
- Smart streak calculation (handles same-day/previous-day writing)
- Optional one-day grace period to allow missing a single day
- Desktop only - no status bar on mobile

## Configuration
In Settings â†’ Writing Streak:
- **Folder path**: Set your target folder to monitor. Leave empty to monitor all files.
- **One day grace**: Enable to allow streaks to continue when missing a single day.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure folder path is correct
- Try refreshing the plugin
- Check file timestamps if streak seems wrong
- Manually refresh the streak

### Manual refresh

You can manually refresh the streak by:
- Using the command palette: "Refresh writing streak"
- Clicking the "Refresh" button in the plugin settings

## Streak logic

The streak counter:
- **Starts counting** from consecutive days with file activity
- **Continues** as long as you have file activity each day
- **Tracks** both the created date and last updated date of a file
- **Breaks** when there's no activity for consecutive days (configurable with grace period)
- **Grace period** (optional): When enabled, allows missing a single day without breaking the streak
